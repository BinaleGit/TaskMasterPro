        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
            Welcome to the <strong>AI-powered To-do List</strong>, an intelligent task management app designed to help you prioritize and manage your tasks efficiently.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
            This app uses machine learning algorithms to assign priorities to tasks based on deadlines and estimated completion times. It helps you focus on the most urgent and important tasks first by automatically sorting tasks into categories such as <strong>Past Due</strong>, <strong>Today</strong>, <strong>Tomorrow</strong>, and <strong>Upcoming</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-500 mb-4">Key Features</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg mb-6">
            <li>Smart priority prediction using AI.</li>
            <li>Automatic grouping of tasks by deadlines.</li>
            <li>User-friendly interface with color-coded task lists for better visual organization.</li>
            <li>Easy addition and management of tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-500 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
            The app uses a machine learning model that takes into account the estimated time required for a task and the task's deadline. Based on these inputs and your custom priority, the app calculates a final priority and orders the tasks accordingly. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
            The app is constantly learning and can be retrained as more tasks are added, ensuring that the task prioritization improves over time.
        </p>
